<h1>The Known Laws, History & Interesting Phenomena Of Our Universe</h1>

<p>This page will cover a variety of information in regards to the laws, history and reccuring phenomena</p>
<p>in our universe that is (as far as everyone in the modern era is aware) completely concrete and known to be</p>
<p>fact, with relatively little room for inaccuracy, additionally covering miscellaneous items simply for the sake of</p>
<p>giving entertaining trivia.</p>

</br>

<p>The universe is a large and complex thing, being dictated by various laws and has objects/phenomena that regardless of circumstance or environment,</p>
<p>are unchanging, things that are constant and universal, such as gravity, magnetism, time, the laws of physics, thermodynamics and the like, there are</p>
<p>additionally a plethora of celestial bodies and phenomena that fill the infinitely expanding space of the universe that are each fascinating topics of discussion.</p>
<p>(Note that when items are listed, such as different types of stars or planets, those lists do not contain all existing items that belong in the list, for the full lists, go to</p>
<p>the links for related sites to the topics that are covered in the aforementioned lists.)</p>

<h1>The History Of The Universe & Its Inevitable Future</h1>
<img src="Source/UniverseHistory.jpeg" alt="Universe History Timeline Image" width="437" height="230">

</br>

<h2>The Big Bang</h2>

<p>Approx. 13.8 billion years ago, all matter and energy in the universe was concentrated into an extraordinarily small, hot and dense region of space known as a "singularity",</p>
<p>which expanded in a sudden, explosive manner, hence the name "big bang"</p>

</br>

<h2>The Formation Of The Known Universe</h2>

<p>As the universe expanded, it cooled down immensely, allowing neutrons, protons and electrons to form, which then combined into nuclei and eventually </p>
<p>hydrogen atoms which were pulled together by gravity to form clumps that would grow into the first stars and light up the universe roughly 400,000 years later.</p>

</br>

<h2>The Universe's State In Modern Times</h2>

<p>In present times, the chaos of the constant formation and crashing together of celestial bodies has near entirely ceased, but the universe is still highly active, with it</p>
<p>being rather easy to observe many stars going through their life cycles and going supernova, asteroids moving through space and distant galaxies swirling around supermassive</p>
<p>black holes if you use any of the relevant modern technology to do so.</p>

</br>

<h2>The Universe's End</h2>

<p>Once all of the limited matter and energy have been spread out so thin across the unlimited space of the universe, once all black holes have lost their mass and ceased to be,</p>
<p>the entropy of the universe will have reached maximum, meaning that the universe is in its most chaotic possible state, with the greatest amount of different things that can be</p>
<p>happening at once, the most varied state of the universe, but ultimately, "nothing" will happen, neutrons, electrons and protons will move about erratically and endlessly, with</p>
<p>the probability of something being created like anything from the old universe would be incalculably small.</p>

<h1>The Four Fundamental Interactions</h1>
<img src="Source/FourFundamentals.jpeg" alt="Image Explaining Four Fundamental Interactions" width="392" height="234">
</br>

<h2>Electromagnetism</h2>

<p>Electromagnetism is one of the four fundamental interactions, it is an interaction that occurs between particles with electric charge via electromagnetic fields, it is the dominant</p>
<p>force in the interaction of atoms and molecules, electromagnetism, as the name implies, can be thought of as a combination of electrostatics and magnetism, which are distinct but</p>
<p>closely intertwined phenomena. Electromagnetic forces occur between any two charged particles and cause an attraction between particles with opposite charges and repulsion between</p>
<p>particles with the same charge, while magnetism is an interaction that occurs between charged particles in relative motion, The electromagnetic force is responsible for many of the</p>
<p>chemical and physical phenomena observed in daily life, its most obvious being our electronic devices, one of which you are using to read through this website.</p>

</br>

<h2>Gravity</h2>

<p>Gravity, the force that causes all matter to mutually attract, the greater the mass, the greater the attraction, gravity is what is known as a fundamental interaction and it is the</p>
<p>weakest of the four fundamental interactions by far, causing it to have abysmal influence at the scale of subatomic particles, but it is the most significant of the fundamental</p>
<p>interactions on a macroscopic scale, determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, light and *nearly* everything else. It is gravity that allowed the formation of the universe</p>
<p>after the big bang, all of the stars, nebulae, planets and galaxies were formed solely by the influence of gravity.</p>

</br>

<h2>Weak Interaction</h2>

<p>Weak interaction, also known as the weak force, is the mechanism of interaction between subatomic particles that is responsible for the radioactive decay of atoms, as well as</p>
<p>as well as nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, all weak interactions are ultimately between elemntary particles and the effective range of weak interaction is limited to</p>
<p>subatomic distances and is less than the diameter  of a proton. In the weak interaction, fermions can exchange three types of force carriers, namely W+, W−, and Z bosons.</p>
<p>The masses of these bosons are far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the weak force, in fact, the force is termed weak</p>
<p>because its field strength over any set distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the electromagnetic force, which itself is further orders of magnitude</p>
<p>less than the strong nuclear force. The weak interaction is the only fundamental interaction that breaks parity symmetry, and similarly, but far more rarely, the only interaction to</p>
<p>break charge–parity symmetry.</p>

</br>

<h2>Strong Interaction</h2>

<p>The strong interaction, also known as the strong force or strong nuclear force, is a fundamental interaction that confines quarks into protons, neutrons, and other hadron particles.</p>
<p>The strong interaction also binds neutrons and protons to create atomic nuclei, where it is called the nuclear force. Most of the mass of a proton or neutron is the result of the strong</p>
<p>interaction energy; the individual quarks provide only about 1% of the mass of a proton. At the range of 10 to the −15 m (1 femtometer, slightly more than the radius of a nucleon),</p>
<p>the strong force is approximately 100 times as strong as electromagnetism, 10 to the 6 times as strong as the weak interaction, and 10 to the 38 times as strong as gravitation.</p>
<p>In the context of atomic nuclei, the force binds protons and neutrons together to form a nucleus and is called the nuclear force (or residual strong force). Because the force is</p>
<p>mediated by massive, short lived mesons on this scale, the residual strong interaction obeys a distance-dependent behavior between nucleons that is quite different from when it is</p>
<p>acting to bind quarks within hadrons. There are also differences in the binding energies of the nuclear force with regard to nuclear fusion versus nuclear fission. Nuclear fusion</p>
<p>accounts for most energy production in the Sun and other stars. Nuclear fission allows for decay of radioactive elements and isotopes, although it is often mediated by the weak interaction.</p>
<p>Artificially, the energy associated with the nuclear force is partially released in nuclear power and nuclear weapons, both in uranium or plutonium-based fission weapons and in fusion weapons</p>
<p>like the hydrogen bomb.</p>

<h1>Interesting Celestial Bodies</h1>
<img src="Source/CeleBodies.jpeg" alt="Image Of Milky Way" width="343" height="234">
</br>

<h2>Black Holes</h2>

<p>A black hole is a large astronomical object with such a strong gravitational pull that nothing, not even light, can escape it. A black hole's "surface" known as its event horizon,</p>
<p>defines the boundary where the velocity needed to escape exceeds the speed of light, which is the speed limit of the cosmos. Matter and radiation fall in, but they can’t get out.</p>
<p>Two main classes of black holes have been extensively observed. Stellar-mass black holes with three to dozens of times the Sun’s mass are spread throughout our Milky Way galaxy,</p>
<p>while supermassive monsters weighing 100,000 to billions of solar masses are found in the centers of most big galaxies, ours included. Astronomers had long suspected an in-between</p>
<p>class called intermediate-mass black holes, weighing 100 to more than 10,000 solar masses. While a handful of candidates have been identified with indirect evidence, the most convincing</p>
<p>example to date came on May 21, 2019, when the National Science Foundation’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), located in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington,</p>
<p>detected gravitational waves from a merger of two stellar-mass black holes. This event, dubbed GW190521, resulted in a black hole weighing 142 Suns. A stellar-mass black hole forms when a star with more</p>
<p>than 20 solar masses exhausts the nuclear fuel in its core and collapses under its own weight. The collapse triggers a supernova explosion that blows off the star’s outer layers. But if the crushed core</p>
<p>contains more than about three times the Sun’s mass, no known force can stop its collapse to a black hole. The origin of supermassive black holes is poorly understood, but we know they exist from the very</p>
<p>earliest days of a galaxy’s lifetime. Once born, black holes can grow by accreting matter that falls into them, including gas stripped from neighboring stars and even other black holes.</p>

</br>

<h2>Stars</h2>

<p>Main Sequence Stars: A normal star forms from a clump of dust and gas in a stellar nursery. Over hundreds of thousands of years, the clump gains mass, starts to spin, and heats up. When the clump's core heats</p>
<p>up to millions of degrees, nuclear fusion starts. This process occurs when two protons, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms, merge to form one helium nucleus. Fusion releases energy that heats the star, creating pressure</p>
<p>that pushes against the force of its gravity. A star is born. Scientists call a star that is fusing hydrogen to helium in its core a main sequence star. Main sequence stars make up around 90% of the universe’s stellar</p>
<p>population. They range in luminosity, color, and size – from a tenth to 200 times the Sun’s mass – and live for millions to billions of years. For Stargazers: Many main sequence stars can be seen with the unaided eye,</p>
<p>such as Sirius – the brightest star in the night sky – in the northern constellation Canis Major. Rigil Kentaurus (better known as Alpha Centauri) in the southern constellation Centaurus is the closest main sequence star</p>
<p>that can be seen with the unaided eye.</p>

</br>

<p>Red Giants: When a main sequence star less than eight times the Sun’s mass runs out of hydrogen in its core, it starts to collapse because the energy produced by fusion is the only force fighting gravity’s tendency to pull</p>
<p>matter together. But squeezing the core also increases its temperature and pressure, so much so that its helium starts to fuse into carbon, which also releases energy. Hydrogen fusion begins moving into the star’s outer layers,</p>
<p>causing them to expand. The result is a red giant, which would appear more orange than red. Eventually, the red giant becomes unstable and begins pulsating, periodically expanding and ejecting some of its atmosphere. Eventually,</p>
<p>all of its outer layers blow away, creating an expanding cloud of dust and gas called a planetary nebula. The Sun will become a red giant in about 5 billion years. For Stargazers: Arcturus in the northern constellation Boötes and</p>
<p>Gamma Crucis in the southern constellation Crux (the Southern Cross) are red giants visible to the unaided eye.</p>

</br>

<h2>Planets</h2>

<p>List Of Planet Types By Composition:</p>

</br>

<p>Chthonian Planet: An extrasolar planet that orbits close to its parent star. Most Chthonian planets are expected to be gas giants that had their atmosphere stripped away, leaving</p>
<p>their cores.</p>

</br>

<p>Carbon Planet: A theoretical terrestrial planet that could form if protoplanetary discs are carbon-rich and oxygen-poor.</p>

</br>

<p>Coreless Planet: A theoretical planet that has undergone planetary differentiation but has no metallic core. Not to be confused with the Hollow Earth concept.</p>

</br>

<p>Desert Planet: A terrestrial planet with an arid surface consistency similar to Earth's deserts.</p>

</br>

<p>Gas Dwarf: A low-mass planet composed primarily of hydrogen and helium.</p>

</br>

<p>Gas Giant: A massive planet composed primarily of hydrogen and helium.</p>

</br>

<h2>Galaxies</h2>

<p>Spiral Galaxies: Our Milky Way is one example of a broad class of galaxies defined by the presence of spiral arms. These galaxies resemble giant rotating pinwheels with a pancake-like</p>
<p>disk of stars and a central bulge or tight concentration of stars. The spiral arms can be wound tightly or loosely, and some cannot be seen from Earth because we view the galaxy from the</p>
<p>side, edge on. Spiral galaxies are surrounded by halos, mixtures of old stars, star clusters, and dark matter – invisible material that does not emit or reflect light but still has a</p>
<p>gravitational pull on other matter. The youngest stars form in gas-rich arms, while older stars can be found throughout the disk and within the bulge and halo. Both the Milky Way and</p>
<p>the Andromeda galaxies belong to a subtype known as barred spirals, which make up two-thirds of the group. Barred spirals sport ribbons of stars, gas, and dust that cut across their</p>
<p>centers. Scientists think the presence of a bar indicates that a galaxy has reached full maturity.</p>

</br>

<p>Elliptical Galaxies: Elliptical galaxies have shapes that range from completely round to oval. They are less common than spiral galaxies. Unlike spirals, elliptical galaxies usually</p>
<p>contain little gas and dust and show very little organization or structure. The stars orbit around the core in random directions and are generally older than those in spiral galaxies</p>
<p>since little of the gas needed to form new stars remains. Scientists think elliptical galaxies originate from collisions and mergers with spirals.</p>

</br>

<p>Lenticular Galaxies: Lenticular galaxies are a kind of cross between spirals and ellipticals. They have the central bulge and disk common to spiral galaxies but no arms. But like</p>
<p>ellipticals, lenticular galaxies have older stellar populations and little ongoing star formation. Scientists have a few theories about how lenticular galaxies evolved. One idea</p>
<p>suggests these galaxies are older spirals whose arms have faded. Another proposes that lenticulars formed from mergers of spiral galaxies.</p>
