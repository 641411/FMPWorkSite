<h1>Theoretical & Hypothetical Cosmic Concepts</h1>

<p>This page will cover a variety of information about concepts related to the functioning of the universe and what lies beyond our immediate</p>
<p>understanding of it that are either purely hypothetical or simply not fully proven, it will also cover certain astral bodies, objects</p>
<p>and phenomena that, while we know to exist, we do not fully understand.</p>

<h1>Quantum Physics & All That May Exist On A Quantum Scale</h1>
<img src="Source/Quarks.jpeg" alt="Image Of Quarks" width="202" height="234">
</br>

<h2>Quarks</h2>

<p>A quark is a type of elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are</p>
<p>protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. All commonly observable matter is composed of up quarks, down quarks and electrons. Owing to a phenomenon known as color</p>
<p>confinement, quarks are never found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, which include baryons (such as protons and neutrons) and mesons, or in quark–gluon plasmas.</p>
<p>For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of hadrons. Quarks have various intrinsic properties, including electric charge, mass, color charge,</p>
<p>and spin. They are the only elementary particles in the Standard Model of particle physics to experience all four fundamental interactions, also known as fundamental forces</p>
<p>(electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction), as well as the only known particles whose electric charges are not integer multiples of the elementary charge.</p>
<p>There are six types, known as flavors, of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Up and down quarks have the lowest masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change</p>
<p>into up and down quarks through a process of particle decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and</p>
<p>the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators).</p>
<p>For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties (such as the electric charge) have</p>
<p>equal magnitude but opposite sign. The quark model was independently proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964. Quarks were introduced as parts of an ordering scheme for hadrons,</p>
<p>and there was little evidence for their physical existence until deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968. Accelerator program experiments have provided</p>
<p>evidence for all six flavors. The top quark, first observed at Fermilab in 1995, was the last to be discovered.</p>

</br>

<h2>String Theory</h2>

<p>In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how these strings</p>
<p>propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string acts like a particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational</p>
<p>state of the string. In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries the gravitational force. Thus, string theory is a</p>
<p>theory of quantum gravity. String theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of fundamental physics. String theory has contributed a number of advances to mathematical</p>
<p>physics, which have been applied to a variety of problems in black hole physics, early universe cosmology, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics, and it has stimulated a number of major developments in pure</p>
<p>mathematics. Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, it is a candidate for a theory of everything, a self-contained mathematical model that describes all</p>
<p>fundamental forces and forms of matter. Despite much work on these problems, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of its details.</p>

</br>

<h2>Superstring Theory</h2>

<p>Superstring theory is an attempt to explain all of the particles and fundamental forces of nature in one theory by modeling them as vibrations of tiny supersymmetric strings. 'Superstring theory' is a shorthand for</p>
<p>supersymmetric string theory because unlike bosonic string theory, it is the version of string theory that accounts for both fermions and bosons and incorporates supersymmetry to model gravity. Since the second superstring</p>
<p>revolution, the five superstring theories (Type I, Type IIA, Type IIB, HO and HE) are regarded as different limits of a single theory tentatively called M-theory.</p>

</br>

<h2>Quantum Field Theory</h2>

<p>In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is a theoretical framework that combines field theory and the principle of relativity with ideas behind quantum mechanics. QFT is used in particle physics to</p>
<p>construct physical models of subatomic particles and in condensed matter physics to construct models of quasiparticles. The current standard model of particle physics is based on QFT. Quantum field theory emerged from the</p>
<p>work of generations of theoretical physicists spanning much of the 20th century. Its development began in the 1920s with the description of interactions between light and electrons, culminating in the first quantum field</p>
<p>theory—quantum electrodynamics. A major theoretical obstacle soon followed with the appearance and persistence of various infinities in perturbative calculations, a problem only resolved in the 1950s with the invention of</p>
<p>the renormalization procedure. A second major barrier came with QFT's apparent inability to describe the weak and strong interactions, to the point where some theorists called for the abandonment of the field theoretic approach.</p>
<p>The development of gauge theory and the completion of the Standard Model in the 1970s led to a renaissance of quantum field theory.</p>

</br>

<h2>M-Theory</h2>

<p>M-theory is a theory in physics that unifies all consistent versions of superstring theory. Edward Witten first conjectured the existence of such a theory at a string theory conference at the University of Southern California in 1995.</p>
<p>Witten's announcement initiated a flurry of research activity known as the second superstring revolution. Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had identified five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories</p>
<p>initially appeared to be very different, work by many physicists showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. Physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations</p>
<p>called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was based in part on the existence of these dualities and in part on the relationship of the string theories to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.</p>

<h1>Higher Spatial Dimensions & Alternate Universes</h1>

</br>

<h2>4th Dimensional Space</h2>

<p>Four-dimensional space (4D) is the mathematical extension of the concept of three-dimensional space (3D). Three-dimensional space is the simplest possible abstraction of the observation</p>
<p>that one needs only three numbers, called dimensions, to describe the sizes or locations of objects in the everyday world. For example, the volume of a rectangular box is found by measuring</p>
<p>and multiplying its length, width, and height (often labeled x, y, and z). This concept of ordinary space is called Euclidean space because it corresponds to Euclid's geometry, which was<p>
<p>originally abstracted from the spatial experiences of everyday life. The idea of adding a fourth dimension appears in Jean le Rond d'Alembert's "Dimensions", published in 1754, but the</p>
<p>mathematics of more than three dimensions only emerged in the 19th century. The general concept of Euclidean space with any number of dimensions was fully developed by the Swiss</p>
<p>mathematician Ludwig Schläfli before 1853. Schläfli's work received little attention during his lifetime and was published only posthumously, in 1901, but meanwhile the fourth Euclidean</p>
<p>dimension was rediscovered by others. In 1880 Charles Howard Hinton popularized it in an essay, "What is the Fourth Dimension?", in which he explained the concept of a "four-dimensional cube"</p>
<p>with a step-by-step generalization of the properties of lines, squares, and cubes. The simplest form of Hinton's method is to draw two ordinary 3D cubes in 2D space, one encompassing the other,</p>
<p>separated by an "unseen" distance, and then draw lines between their equivalent vertices. This can be seen in the accompanying animation whenever it shows a smaller inner cube inside a larger</p>
<p>outer cube. The eight lines connecting the vertices of the two cubes in this case represent a single direction in the "unseen" fourth dimension.</p>

</br>

<h2>Multiverse Theory</h2>

<p>The multiverse is the hypothetical set of all universes, and a form of foundational monism and pseudopluralism (true cosmological pluralism includes infinite separate families of universes and the</p>
<p>rejection of the [single] universal deeper [meta] foundations). Together, these universes are presumed to comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information,</p>
<p>and the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different universes within the multiverse are called "parallel universes", "flat universes", "other universes", "alternate universes",</p>
<p>"multiple universes", "plane universes", "parent and child universes", "many universes", or "many worlds". One common assumption is that the multiverse is a "patchwork quilt of separate universes</p>
<p>all bound by the same laws of physics." The concept of multiple universes, or a multiverse, has been discussed throughout history. It has evolved and has been debated in various fields, including</p>
<p>cosmology, physics, and philosophy. Some physicists argue that the multiverse is a philosophical notion rather than a scientific hypothesis, as it cannot be empirically falsified. In recent years,</p>
<p>there have been proponents and skeptics of multiverse theories within the physics community. Although some scientists have analyzed data in search of evidence for other universes, no statistically</p>
<p>significant evidence has been found. Critics argue that the multiverse concept lacks testability and falsifiability, which are essential for scientific inquiry, and that it raises unresolved</p>
<p>metaphysical issues.</p>

<h1>Concepts That Are Not Fully Understood</h1>

</br>

<h2>Time</h2>

<p>There are a plethora of different theories and trains of thought developed in relation to our modern understanding of time and how it functions, the most relevant is Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.</p>
<p>The theory of relativity usually encompasses two interrelated physics theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity, proposed and published in 1905 and 1915, respectively.</p>
<p>Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to the forces of nature. It applies to the</p>
<p>cosmological and astrophysical realm, including astronomy. The theory transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century, superseding a 200-year-old theory of mechanics created</p>
<p>primarily by Isaac Newton. It introduced concepts including 4-dimensional spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, relativity of simultaneity, kinematic and gravitational time dilation, and</p>
<p>length contraction. In the field of physics, relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the nuclear age. With relativity,</p>
<p>cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves. Albert Einstein published the theory of special relativity</p>
<p>in 1905, building on many theoretical results and empirical findings obtained by Albert A. Michelson, Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincaré and others. Max Planck, Hermann Minkowski and others did</p>
<p>subsequent work. Einstein developed general relativity between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by many others after 1915. The final form of general relativity was published in 1916. The term</p>
<p>"theory of relativity" was based on the expression "relative theory" (German: Relativtheorie) used in 1906 by Planck, who emphasized how the theory uses the principle of relativity. In the</p>
<p>discussion section of the same paper, Alfred Bucherer used for the first time the expression "theory of relativity" (German: Relativitätstheorie). By the 1920s, the physics community understood</p>
<p>and accepted special relativity. It rapidly became a significant and necessary tool for theorists and experimentalists in the new fields of atomic physics, nuclear physics, and quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>By comparison, general relativity did not appear to be as useful, beyond making minor corrections to predictions of Newtonian gravitation theory. It seemed to offer little potential for experimental</p>
<p>test, as most of its assertions were on an astronomical scale. Its mathematics seemed difficult and fully understandable only by a small number of people. Around 1960, general relativity became central</p>
<p>to physics and astronomy. New mathematical techniques to apply to general relativity streamlined calculations and made its concepts more easily visualized. As astronomical phenomena were discovered,</p>
<p>such as quasars (1963), the 3-kelvin microwave background radiation (1965), pulsars (1967), and the first black hole candidates (1981), the theory explained their attributes, and measurement of them</p>
<p>further confirmed the theory.</p>
